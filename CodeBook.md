the original datasets contained 561 variables. after combining all datasets extracting all variables containing std() and mean() values and adding corresponding subject and activity variables the resulting data set is stored in res data frame (10299 obs. X 68 variables)

The avg_data data frame is created from res with aggregate function, grouping 2 first variables and applying mean function to each group (per activity per subject)

the resulting data set has the following variables

 [1] "activity"
